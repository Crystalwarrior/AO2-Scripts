USAGE:
type powershell in your file browser address bar, then copy-paste this in:
.\Process-Evidence.ps1 -InputFile "input.txt" -OutputFile "output.txt" -Pos "all"

replace input.txt with the file containing your INPUT
replace output.tixt with the file you want to OUTPUT to
for -Pos "all", replace the word all with whatever position you want the evidence to be on

Once you're done. Open the output.txt, copy-paste that into a piece of evidence in AO,
name it something simple like "a" and as a GM use /demo a to import all the evidence into the area!
