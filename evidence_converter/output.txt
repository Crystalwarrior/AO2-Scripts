/evidence_add "Stools" "<owner=all>
A long row of aged bar stools, each with a worn leather cushion and rusting metal base. Some are tilted slightly, with only a few still facing the counter." DRIO/Bar/Stools.png%
/evidence_add "Mirror Wall" "<owner=all>
A wide, cracked mirror lines the wall behind the bar, reflecting distorted images of glowing bottles and dark corners. Wooden shelving holds a sparse, dusty collection of drinks and decor, including some glassware still upright. A few warm lights behind the shelves provide a hazy glow.

/evidence_add "Lounge Area" "<owner=all>
A few tables remain standing in the corner of the room near tribal-patterned pillars. Scattered papers, menus, and broken glass litter the surfaces. One bottle still stands upright, next to a mold-covered ashtray.
